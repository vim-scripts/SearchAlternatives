DESCRIPTION
This plugin provides mappings and commands to add and subtract alternative
branches to the current search pattern. Currently searching for "foo," but
also want to find matches for "bar"? You could type /foo\|bar<CR> or
/<C-R>/\|bar<CR>, but once you want to limit the search to whole \<words\>
(like the star command), and juggle several alternatives, adding and
dropping them as you search, this plugin is quicker than manually editing the
search command-line (which you can still do).

RELATED WORKS
- Add to Word Search (vimscript #3955) can add the keyword under the cursor to
  the search pattern and search forward / backward like * / #.
